**Description**


For this project, I was given a set of financial records and tasked with analysing them. To do this, I needed to apply fundamental Javascript skills in order to process financial information and display the outputs in the console log. The results needed to consist of:


Total number of months.
Total profit over the entire period the dataset covered.
Average monthly change in profit/loss over the entire period.
Greatest monthly increase.
Greatest monthly decrease.


The screenshot below shows the expected outputs:

**Issues**


I started off by trying to work out the simplest method of approaching this challenge. I knew that there were multiple ways to achieve the outcome.


I found the average changes analysis to be the most challenging. I knew how to work out the math; by adding together the monthly changes (difference in profit/loss from month to month) and dividing by the total amount of months, but it took additional research to understand that the logic that I would need to use would be to subtract the previous month from the current before dividing the total amount by the total amount of months. When I discovered this, it made sense and matched the math logic that I started with.


Additionally, I needed to conduct additional research to understand how to round numbers. This will be something that I need to practise to consolidate.



**Usage**


This project may be useful to those learning Javascript fundamental concepts, including:


1. Pseudo coding
2. Variables
3. 2D arrays
4. For loops
5. Functions
6. Commenting within the code


The outputs in the console from this task can be viewed in the screenshot below:

**Instructions to view my work in the console log:**


To view the code the .html file can be accessed from the repo. 
Once accessed, open with Chrome.
The following webpage should be visible.
Use Chrome Devtools by right clicking on the page and selecting inspect.
Once the Devtools are open, navigate to the console tab.
